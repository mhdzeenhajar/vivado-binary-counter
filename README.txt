# Vivado Binary Counter

## Project Overview
This project implements a **4-bit binary counter** using Xilinx Vivado. It was designed to demonstrate digital logic principles, specifically sequential circuits and clock division on an FPGA.

## Simulation Results
Below is the behavioral simulation waveform verifying the counter's operation:
